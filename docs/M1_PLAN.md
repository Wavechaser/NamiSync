# M1 Delivery Register

This is the sole active M1 delivery register. It records remaining accepted outcomes, their order, and the verification that closes each one. Implemented contracts are owned by their active subject documents; completed delivery history and superseded mechanisms are in [obsolete](obsolete/). The archived plan files retain historical staging and review but are not instructions for new work.

[BRIDGE.md](BRIDGE.md) owns external command, transport, retry/recovery, and bridge-gate contracts. [PRESENTATION.md](PRESENTATION.md) owns trees, views, search, selection, sorting, and scale evidence. [INTERFACES.md](INTERFACES.md) owns implemented task lifecycle and desktop host/package rules. [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), and [DEFENSE.md](DEFENSE.md) remain the owners of product behavior, cross-layer meaning, and safety/evidence policy.

[PRODUCTION_REDUCTION.md](PRODUCTION_REDUCTION.md) is the closed maintenance
subregister for the completed production-ablation pass under M1-12. Its PR-0
through PR-9 rows remove redundant implementation and test prescriptions; they
do not add, defer, or reinterpret an M1 product outcome.

## Main objectives and current boundary

[REDUCTION_FOLLOWUP.md](REDUCTION_FOLLOWUP.md) owns the accepted narrow
immutable-value, scan-validation, history encoding/projection, and executor
simplification follow-up under M1-12. Its NR-0–NR-9 register and migrated RF-E/RF-X
dispositions preserve existing product outcomes; implementation and integrated
verification are complete. Further product simplification is outside the
remaining frontend delivery scope.

The secured desktop host and transport, presentation foundation, current service/CLI surface, and implemented ledger/history boundary are active. The frozen v1 event-and-transport custody claim remains closed at its bridge evidence owner. That closure does not establish whole-runtime containment.

Finish the process-live desktop task surfaces, shared location admission and
frozen Setup, reviewed execution, execution/inventory projections, integrity
controls and first manual post-copy verification, then release closure. These
remain unrealized frontend outcomes. The history page, global-settings mutation
page, drag-and-drop, file-scoped planning, durable task survival across a process
restart, durable sort preferences, status/progress or global-flat sorting, and
compare-and-accept rebaseline semantics remain deferred. User-facing terminal
execution/verification retries (including Verify remaining), user-invoked session
cleanup/trash purge, and richer I/O error categories are deferred to M2; see the
feature-only [M2 proposal](M2_PROPOSAL.md). Existing automatic retries, owned-temp
recovery, transport replay, close/shutdown recovery, and live pause/resume are
not removed by those deferrals.

The prior aggregate complete-owner-graph model and BR-G-45 are retired. No future work inherits its reservation, DTO, lease, byte-budget, command-count, or representation recipe. The bounded M1-4 row and detail below replace the former task lifecycle/retention preservation checkpoint. Existing externally enforced ingress and population bounds remain active independently.

## Remaining checkpoints

### Documentation reconciliation pass (2026-09-09)

This closed maintenance register covers the accepted frontend decisions and
branch reconciliation only. It does not authorize product or test changes,
executor restructuring, new retry/cleanup mechanisms, or revival of compact-plan
memory prescriptions. Existing safety and measurement policy in `AGENTS.md` and
`DEFENSE.md` remains unchanged.

| ID | Accepted outcome | Named verification | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DOC-1 | Reconcile M1 lifecycle, fresh replanning, terminal actions, capacity/I/O presentation, trash information, and M2 deferrals across active subject docs; consolidate maintenance history and inspect defect sections. | Reviewed against service/executor behavior and accepted decisions; active-doc contradiction search, all 148 local links/anchors in 34 active Markdown files, history-preservation checks, docs-only scope, diff whitespace, and fresh adversarial review passed. BUGS module sections remain appropriate; no entry changes. | Verified for documentation commit |
| DOC-2 | Remove only the four superseded compact-plan commits from `milestone1` after DOC-1 is committed and verified, then open a draft PR from `milestone1-anthony`. | Verify exact divergence and remote tips, preserve the old tip in a recovery ref, reset only the named base branch, verify the resulting PR base/head/draft state and clean current worktree. Unexpected additional base-branch commits or unaccounted work stop this row for adjudication. | Pending |

Discovery is limited to active Markdown documentation and the service, workflow,
executor, projection, and test evidence needed to distinguish current behavior
from accepted targets. Findings outside these decisions are reported, not fixed.
No product suite rerun is claimed by a documentation-only check. DOC-2 depends
on DOC-1; no merge or implementation of remaining M1 rows is authorized here.

### Product delivery register

Each checkpoint is a closed register row. A new finding does not enlarge a row; apply the repository containment rules in `AGENTS.md`. A change begins only after its row has named the relevant active subject contracts and finite verification. The row's verification is in addition to ordinary affected department and consumer checks.

| ID | Accepted outcome | Dependencies and named verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1-4 | Deliver process-live task page creation, rail selection/navigation, and explicit closure using the existing lifecycle owners. Bodies remain blank until their owning content checkpoints activate. | The bounded checkpoint detail below replaces the former CP4 preservation scope. Verify task identity/state, navigation and reinjection, stale responses, terminal release versus task retention, cancel-settle-close, failed close, and existing admission bounds through service and headed desktop paths. No future content projections or domain retry controls. |
| M1-5 | Give Setup and inventory one workflow-owned location-candidate pipeline with typed admission results and bounded remembered locations. | Verify parser refusals; leaf/reparse/placeholder and long paths; missing, offline, remount, and clone ambiguity; bounded recents; activation/slot races and purpose mismatch. Review path parsing and TOCTOU. Scanner, preflight, executor, and verifier retain fresh re-probes. |
| M1-6 | Deliver frozen, backend-canonical Setup, typed/picker/recent inputs, standalone inventory creation, serial best-effort pair creation, and explicit Plan-again after fresh reviewed-identity resolution. | Verify bounded inputs, canonical snapshots, immediate invalidation, no global-default mutation or browser filter normalization, partial-pair refusal, mixed batches, replay/recovery, slot/plan-generation races, and headed hostile-text/picker/recent flows. Map needed command behavior in BRIDGE when this activates; do not prescribe the retired 18-command expansion. |
| M1-7 | Deliver bounded plan review, selection, execution admission, and the full plan consumer for sibling sorting. A review remains truthful when execution never ran; an admitted attempt keeps its selection committed. | Exercise plan publication, selection and commitment freshness, stale/replayed mutation, admission-failure rollback versus post-admission preflight refusal, fresh Plan-again review after source/target changes, destructive confirmation, controls, windows/anchors/search/filter, and headed production flows. No terminal selection reopening or subset retry. BRIDGE and PRESENTATION define protocol and projection criteria. |
| M1-8-capacity | Distinguish recognized disk-capacity I/O failure and stop admission of later executor operations after settling the current operation. | Before M1-8, use the existing failure-policy/Stop and settlement paths; verify direct and wrapped capacity failures, ordinary I/O distinction, current-effect/recording truth, later work left unrun, terminal projection, and unchanged sharing-violation retries. Run executor plus core/workflow/interface consumers and the retained settlement oracle. No general I/O taxonomy or settlement restructuring. |
| M1-8 | Deliver live and retained execution review with bounded item windows, exact execution overlays, task/item recording issues, terminal axes, current ledger evidence, capacity/generic-I/O messages, and informational trash location. | Test filesystem/recording combinations, overlay and omission invariants, Gap plus terminal reconciliation, navigation/re-observation, generic unrun presentation, yellow capacity without hiding known failures, bounded evidence queries, and post-copy overlay independence. Trash counts require complete outcome evidence; location-only fallback must not assert a planned count, scan all trash, or imply purge. |
| M1-9 | Deliver bounded inventory projections, current evidence, and the full inventory consumer for sibling sorting. | Test complete or prior-complete publication, warnings outside action scope, raw evidence provenance, search/filter/collapse/window/detail behavior, replacement/races, supported sort/reset production paths, and headed witnesses. |
| M1-10 | Deliver baseline, verify, and rebaseline controls plus the first same-task manual post-copy verification without persistent operation-time hashes. Rebaseline includes eligible null-evidence files and always hashes/replaces evidence; matching content is not a verified match. | Test acknowledgement admission before claim/native work; all-null and mixed rebaseline through workflow, service/CLI, and desktop; conditional-recording and supersession races; handoff classification; live pause/resume/cancel and unchanged automatic failed-read retries; and overlay/result identity boundaries. Terminal Verify-remaining/subset retry is deferred. Independently review the operation matrix and conditional-recording races. |
| M1-12 | First close integrated lifecycle/retention across activated task surfaces (absorbing former M1-11), then complete adversarial, documentation, ordinary, and headed verification. | Exercise plan-only, execution-only, linked/manual verification, inventory, refused, canceled, degraded, and failed tasks across navigation, reinjection, explicit close, and shutdown. Verify existing admission bounds, stale-response suppression, exact resource release and retained result truth; no aggregate-artifact or whole-owner-graph criterion. Run applicable settlement-oracle stability, ordinary/headed suites, installed-wheel/product witnesses, import checks, `git diff --check`, active-link checks, and independent cross-component review. |
| M1-Release | Produce beta packaging and release closure after delivery rows above are complete. | Build/test an installed artifact from a clean checkout; supply frozen specification/dependency/CI, notices and corresponding-source release material, standard-integrity host proof, and every applicable BR-G and SH-G gate. INTERFACES owns host/package and SH-G release criteria; BRIDGE owns BR-G evidence. |

## M1-4 bounded checkpoint detail

**Objective and scope.** Make process-live tasks usable as navigable, closable
pages before adding their domain content. Reuse `TaskLifecycle`,
`SessionObserver`, service task association, and existing bridge delivery;
the population is the existing admitted tasks and their serial sessions, not
history or a new complete result cache. Keep enforced task/request bounds and
exact ownership. Do not add placeholder future DTOs, domain retry/cleanup,
persistent tasks, new aggregate memory certification, or future view controls.

**Acceptance.** Creation publishes one truthful rail/page identity; selecting
another task and returning preserves that task and its current state. Navigation
or document reinjection cannot adopt a stale task/session response. Terminal
session release preserves the task until explicit close. Busy close requests
cancellation immediately, retains the card while settlement/release is pending,
and removes it only on a successful close disposition. Failed close retains
truthful status and a recovery route; no purge or forced task destruction occurs.
Existing task admission refuses excess without eviction. Task bodies remain
blank until the owning later checkpoint supplies their content.

**Regression watchlist and evidence.** Characterize the existing service task
create/claim, terminal release, explicit close, observer retirement, and
admission rollback cases in `tests/test_task_lifecycle.py`,
`tests/test_service.py`, and `tests/test_bridge_service.py`. Add production
desktop witnesses for create/select/return/close, stale response after navigation
and reinjection, pending cancellation, incomplete close, terminal re-observation,
and refusal at the existing task bound. Assert no extra domain start, early
card removal, leaked observer, or fabricated domain result. Reuse existing
backend fixtures rather than building future Setup/review panes for these tests.
Run the interfaces/dispatcher department neighborhood, ordinary suite, and
applicable headed tests using TESTS commands; each named transition must pass.

**Review and commit.** A fresh reviewer traces public service/desktop paths for
early close, stale adoption, repeated gesture effects, and accidental future
content scope. Update INTERFACES, DESKTOP_UI, FEATURES, and this row's status
with evidence before `feat(web): add process-live task navigation and closure`.
One coherent task-shell outcome closes this row; unresolved regressions block
its commit rather than becoming work for a later row.

## Investigation and regression map

The current service rolls `committing` back only when admission fails;
post-admission preflight refusal remains committed. `run_plan` saves a plan
with its review-preflight verdict even when that verdict is negative; a typed
plan-admission limit instead saves no artifact. Existing preflight tests pin
the exact capacity boundary, fresh-world drift, and refusal without plan or
selection mutation. Existing core/planner tests pin operation identities,
selection digests, and dependency closure. Preserve these behavioral witnesses
when implementing fresh Plan again; a digest is not a filesystem snapshot.

The executor already projects generic I/O reasons and accepts `Stop` after
ordinary failure settlement, but its default policy continues non-sharing
failures. M1-8-capacity is a separate reviewable behavior commit before its
frontend consumer. Verify classification through the real error wrapping path,
post-effect and recording outcomes, and the later-operation stop sweep in the
executor runtime/settlement tests, then core/workflow/interface consumers.
Run the ordinary suite and unchanged retained oracle; final review must reject
any new settlement mechanism or capacity label that masks an unrelated failure.
Update EXECUTOR, FEATURES, DESKTOP_UI, and the register with the implemented
boundary and evidence before `feat(executor): stop on recognized capacity failure`.

For test cleanup, retire only unimplemented UI retry/reopening/cleanup promises
from future acceptance lists. Keep direct-service artifact replacement,
admission rollback, protocol replay, close recovery, automatic operation/read
retry, and pause/resume tests. They protect different behavior. Add terminal
action-availability witnesses when each surface activates, including degraded
completion, abnormal termination, and first manual verification. Add trash
location-only and evidence-backed count cases without requiring a full trash
inventory. Green existing tests cannot prove these new frontend outcomes; red
tests justify removal only when their exact retired product promise is named.

All remaining rows are pending product work. The baseline is the implemented
public/CLI, schema/event, authority, and settlement behavior recorded by the
closed reduction registers; those guarantees remain protected. The future
capacity checkpoint changes only the explicitly accepted failure classification
and later-operation admission policy. No implementation recipe from the discarded
compact-plan branch is an additional prerequisite. Product changes follow the
finite rows above, owning subject docs, and AGENTS/DEFENSE stop rules.

## Accepted behavior carried by the delivery rows

Normally completed tasks retain file lists, item statuses, and phase aggregates
for read-only review. Execution-only completion may offer its first eligible
manual verification; linked completion needs no further action. Non-stopping
degradation keeps the normal review experience with visible issues. Canceled or
abnormally terminated sessions retain terminal truth without resume, domain
retry, or session cleanup. Live pause/resume remains separate. Busy task close
requests immediate best-effort cancellation and keeps the card until settlement
and resource release permit closure; close never implies trash purge. Forced
process exit provides no durable task/resume guarantee.

Capacity refusal before execution (including queued wakeup) retains the task
without execution, automatic retry, or automatic close. Scan/planner admission
refusal may have no plan; review preflight can retain an immutable plan with a
negative verdict. Explicit Plan again resolves reviewed location identities,
creates fresh Setup in a new task, scans again, and requires fresh review. It
never copies selection/authorization or changes the old artifact. Disk space
freed by removing source/target entries is accounted for by that fresh scan,
not by assuming that a prior selection digest binds the changed filesystem.

Recognized execution-time disk-capacity failure is the narrow planned addition
above; the current default failure policy continues past non-sharing failures.
Generic I/O already has a typed reason and needs ordinary frontend presentation.
Yellow capacity mapping uses existing DESKTOP_UI semantics and never hides
independent known failures. Trash-location text is accepted for M1; exact
counting is conditional on complete outcome evidence and display placement is
open. No filesystem inventory or purge is added to populate that information.

Location admission is workflow-owned and reused by typed, picker, and recent Setup/inventory inputs. A remembered location is not authorization; every consumer retains its point-of-use re-probe. Setup freezes its semantic plan options in a backend-derived snapshot and never writes global defaults or makes browser text/filter normalization authority.

Plan review must preserve operation, selection, scope, and fresh-preflight truth across view gestures. New views use canonical path-key order; filename, raw size, and raw mtime sorting in either direction and reset to canonical order are accepted M1 behavior. Sorting is process-live view state only and cannot alter selection, commitment, operation/dependency order, risk/counts, or action scope. It orders complete siblings before windowing and preserves node identity/hierarchy. Its exact protocol, validation, and scale evidence belong to BRIDGE and PRESENTATION.

Execution, inventory, and post-copy overlays stay distinct from each other and from ledger-derived state. A zero-byte activity that ran is never presented as unrun. Inventory warnings stay outside path/action scope and publication is complete or retains the prior complete generation. Baseline, verify, and rebaseline remain distinct operations. Rebaseline requires acknowledgement, includes eligible selected null-evidence files, replaces/creates evidence after a fresh hash, clears verification freshness, and does not become compare-and-accept. Manual exact post-copy verification uses an atomic handoff classification, works only on a ready subset, preserves original execution truth, and reports ineligible outcomes truthfully.

Release remains an accepted outcome. [INTERFACES.md](INTERFACES.md#sh-g-release-criteria) owns the open SH-G-15 scoped cold-start and repeated/long-workload resource policy. It has no numeric budget or acceptance artifact yet; runtime request/population bounds and the separate SH-G-8 transport-custody evidence remain unchanged.

## Release completeness

BR-G-43: active docs, README and UI/mockup status must describe shipped behavior.
Map every active DESKTOP_UI acceptance item to its subject check or an explicitly
approved deferral; an omitted item or copied unmapped checklist is not closure.
BR-G-44: from a clean checkout, run the complete suite including ordinary-default
exclusions, lint-imports and diff checks. All test_br_g cases must be collected
and pass without skip/xfail on Windows; narrow selections do not substitute for
release evidence. TESTS owns collection commands and routing. These requirements
remain open release obligations, not an assertion that this docs-only migration
performed a product release run.

## Resumption

DOC-1 documentation reconciliation is verified for commit, followed only by the
authorized DOC-2 branch/PR operation. Neither closes a product delivery row.
After that, begin M1-4 only under a new implementation request; M1-5–M1-10 expose
the remaining backend features vertically, and early M1-12 tests lifecycle
integration across those real surfaces. Trash-message placement remains a UI
choice; the information and count-evidence boundary are fixed.

`HANDOFF.md` records the documentation verification and immediate branch
operation context. Preserve unrelated working files and historical evidence.
Unexpected branch divergence stops DOC-2; supported data loss, unauthorized
mutation, false durable/terminal success, replayed mutation, or inability to
preserve work invokes the repository stop rules rather than expanding scope.
